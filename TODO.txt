= TODO
- Pick random images for humanvsmodel
- Run Bayesian Optimization on model
- Train model on all data
- Run model on all images of training

- Hard Negative Mining > wed 05 oct
- Optimization same SIFT, same BOW size, diff SVM params > thur 06 oct (also run for linear kernel)

- Train model again
> implement the heat-map/nms approach > mon 10 oct
>>> deadline model fri 14 oct and implementation on full image

- Run model on test_set

> wait until final model > fri - tue 18 oct
- Run model on whole images of humanvsmodel experiment
- Analyse agreement humanvsmodel

- Write report in between

- Make presentation! > wed 19 oct
