- Spearmint needs to be installed for this to work: (https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint)
- run with: ```<path to binary of spearmint e.g ~/spearmint/spearmint/bin/spearmint> ./config.pb --drive=local --method=GPEIOptChooser --max-concurrent=2```
- config.pb defines the boundaries of the parameters to test
